                        <p style="text-">Welcome to Speedoz Limited, your trusted partner in high-performance motorcycles and premium riding gear in Bangladesh. Established in November 2009, our journey began amidst a growing enthusiasm for 150cc racing motorcycles among young riders in the early 2008s. These riders, driven by a passion for speed and performance, invested significantly in enhancing their bikes, creating a vibrant culture of group tours, rallies, and camaraderie. Recognizing this burgeoning trend, Speedoz Limited introduced the Megelli 150R racing bike as the sole distributor in Bangladesh, marking the start of our commitment to quality and performance.

                        <p>Soon after, we expanded our offerings with the Naked Sport motorcycle, Spiker. However, our pivotal moment came when we became the sole distributor of Keeway motorcycles in Bangladesh. Keeway, known for its innovative designs by a young and energetic team from Italy and Argentina, offers bikes ranging from 50cc to 600cc. In Bangladesh, we focus on the 100cc to 150cc segment, adhering to local regulations while providing top-tier motorcycles.

                            Keeway's global success led to its integration into the QianJiang Motor Company of China, a significant player in the Asian motorcycle industry. After acquiring a majority stake in the historic Italian brand Benelli in 1998, QJ Motor has leveraged Benelli's 105-year legacy to set new trends in motorcycle design and technology. Since 2015, all our design and technology innovations have stemmed from this powerful collaboration.

                            Speedoz Limited has continually diversified its portfolio to cater to the varied needs of our customers. We introduced the FKM motorcycle brand through FK Motors Limited, a multinational company based in Singapore with German engineering expertise. We also brought the high-end Generic Caferacer to Bangladesh, known for its sharp design and sporty features.
